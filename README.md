# Data Fluency - Acting with Data

So far in the course, we've outlined strategies and techniques for collecting, storing, and analyzing data and interpreting the results of this data from our business perspective. Ultimately, we want to be able to further convert this interpretation into ways that we can make decisions that lead to success.

## Data-driven decision making

Decision making and taking actions based on data involves a process called data-driven decision making. This process involves the following steps:

  1. Define the problem or opportunity: Identify the issue or opportunity that needs to be addressed. It is important to be specific and clearly define the problem or opportunity, as this will help to focus the data collection and analysis efforts.
  2. Collect the data: Gather relevant data from internal and external sources to help inform the decision. This may include data from company databases, market research, customer feedback, or other sources. It is important to ensure that the data is accurate and up-to-date, and to consider any potential biases or limitations in the data.
  3. Analyze the data: Use statistical analysis and other data analysis techniques to uncover insights and patterns in the data. This may involve using tools such as Excel or specialized software like Tableau or R. The goal is to identify trends, correlations, and other patterns that can help to inform the decision-making process.
  4. Present the findings: Visualize and present the results of the data analysis in a clear and concise manner. This may involve creating charts, graphs, or other types of visualizations to help illustrate the key points. It is important to communicate the findings in a way that is easy to understand and relevant to the decision at hand.
  5. Make the decision: Use the insights from the data analysis to inform the decision-making process. This may involve weighing the pros and cons of different options, considering the potential risks and rewards, and seeking input from other stakeholders. It is important to be objective and consider all relevant factors when making the decision.
  6. Take action: Implement the decision and track the results to see if it was effective. This may involve setting up systems to measure and track key performance indicators, and conducting ongoing analysis to assess the impact of the decision. It is important to be flexible and willing to make adjustments as needed based on the results.
  
By following this process, organizations can make more informed decisions and take actions based on data, rather than relying on intuition or gut feelings alone. This can help to improve the effectiveness of decision making and increase the chances of success. Data-driven decision making can be particularly useful in situations where there is a large amount of data available, or where the consequences of a decision may be significant. It is important to note that data should be used as a support for decision making, rather than the sole basis for making decisions. Other factors such as ethical considerations, human judgment, and business context should also be taken into account.

## Data storytelling

Making decisions with data effectively is often closely tied with convincing others of these decisions and the reasons for taking them. This involves data storytelling and techniques for improving that narrative.

Telling a story with data can be a powerful way to communicate information and persuade an audience. However, it's important to do it effectively in order to get your message across. Here are some tips for telling a story with data:

  1. Start with a clear goal in mind: What do you want to accomplish by telling this story? Who is your audience and what background can you assume from them? What do you want your audience to learn or understand? Having a clear goal will help you focus your story and choose the right data to support it.
  2. Choose the right data: Select data that is relevant to your story and supports your argument. Avoid using too much data or data that is not directly related to your story, as it can distract from your main message.
  3. Organize your data: Arrange your data in a logical order that follows a clear narrative. This can help your audience follow your story and understand the main points you are trying to make.
  4. Use visualizations: Graphs, charts, and other visualizations can make it easier for your audience to understand and remember your data. Choose the right visualization for your data and use clear labels and titles to help your audience understand what they are seeing.
  5. Use anecdotes and examples: In addition to data, consider using anecdotes and examples to help bring your story to life. These can help make your story more relatable and memorable for your audience.
  6. Keep it simple: Don't try to cram too much information into your story. Focus on a few key points and use data to support them.
  7. Tell a cohesive story: Make sure all the elements of your story - the data, anecdotes, and examples - fit together and support your main message.
  8. Practice and revise: Practice telling your story out loud and revise as needed to make it as clear and compelling as possible.
  9. Engage your audience: Make sure to engage your audience by asking questions and encouraging them to ask their own. This will help them stay interested and involved in your story.
  
By following these tips, you can effectively tell a story with data that is clear, compelling, and persuasive.

## Processes for working with and understanding data

Lastly, you'll see some common strategies and steps for helping your team work with data effectively.

### Action Research Cycle

There is an important paradigm called the action research cycle that you might have seen before. It relates to how projects are rarely linear. You are constantly cycling through as you have new results or assumptions you had aren't quite met. You might think you have everything planned just right, but when you get to acting you see that your trials lead you to rethink your plan. After you observe you might see that the data won't actually be able to solve the problem at hand and you need to reframe. At the very end, you should come back and revisit your planning to see how you'd change things if you were to do it all over again.

### DIKW pyramid

The DIKW pyramid, also known as the Knowledge Hierarchy, is a model that represents the stages of converting data into knowledge. The acronym DIKW stands for data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. The pyramid is a visual representation of this hierarchy, with data at the base, followed by information, knowledge, and wisdom at the top.

The steps in the DIKW pyramid are:

  - Data: Raw, unorganized facts.
  - Information: Data that has been processed and organized into a meaningful form.
  - Knowledge: Information that has been interpreted and understood, allowing it to be used to inform decision making.
  - Wisdom: The ability to apply knowledge and experience in a way that leads to sound judgment and decision making.
  
The DIKW pyramid is often used as a framework for understanding how data is transformed into useful knowledge and how that knowledge can be applied to solve problems and make decisions.

### CRISP-DM

The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely-used data mining process model that provides a structured approach for data mining projects. It consists of six phases:

  1. Business Understanding: In this phase, the goal is to understand the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, and to identify the data mining goals and the appropriate data mining techniques to be used.
  2. Data Understanding: In this phase, the goal is to collect and explore the data in order to get a better understanding of it. This includes collecting and documenting the data, and performing initial analyses to identify trends and patterns.
  3. Data Preparation: In this phase, the goal is to clean and prepare the data for modeling. This includes handling missing or invalid data, formatting data, and creating derived variables.
  4. Modeling: In this phase, the goal is to build and test data mining/predictive analytics models using the prepared data. This includes selecting the appropriate modeling techniques, training and testing the models, and evaluating their performance.
  5. Evaluation: In this phase, the goal is to evaluate the results of the data mining models and determine whether they meet the project objectives. If the results are not satisfactory, the process may be iterated until an acceptable solution is found.
  6. Deployment: In this phase, the goal is to plan for the deployment of the data mining results. This may include creating a plan for integrating the results into the organization's processes, as well as providing ongoing support for the data mining solution.

The CRISP-DM framework provides a structured and systematic approach for managing data mining/analysis projects, and has been widely adopted by organizations in a variety of industries.
